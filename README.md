# mining-utils
This repository holds some useful scripts to optimize or automate mining operations.

#startup
This script is used to start mining scripts at startup and, if they fail, they can be automatically restarted.

The script is configured with a configuration file in the folder $HOME/.rig (which is the root directory for any other file).
